# Brundij ðŸ¥‘
_Santirix Gremioni's robot, from Isaac's Asimov [The Robots of Dawn](https://www.amazon.com/Robots-Dawn-Robot-Isaac-Asimov/dp/0553299492)_

![Brundij demo in action](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48794198/133950046-77df4596-5d5a-4ce4-9ce2-e24b5beb97a4.gif)

Demo versions of Brundij can be found online:
- [Client](https://brundij-demo.netlify.app/)
- [Server](https://brundij-api-demo.herokuapp.com/swagger) 
  - _p.s.: the server runs on a Heroku free dyno, so it takes a few seconds/minutes to start up_
### About
An open source tool to help teams host squad health checks. Written in Clojure and Clojurescript and powered by awesome libraries such as datahike and re-frame. An attempt on having a working, self-hosted and easy to use squad health check platform. Brundij tries to handle a few main features:

- Users needed to be able to create health checks and share those using it's UUID
- Health checks could be assigned questions (users could choose whether to use the pre-defined ones or mix them with custom ones)
- Users should be able to answer a health check's questions by using the health check's UUID

I also ended up deciding that I wanted users to be able to interact with the application while offline. In other words, this means:
- This application uses google's [workbox](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox) to cache itself
- Health checks and questions are created to datascript and persisted to localStorage when offline `(false? (.-onLine (.-navigator js/window)))`
- Health checks persisted to localStorage can then be sent to the backend when online

##### Development
In order to get a development server up and running you'll need to run `lein repl` after setting up a local postgres database
```bash
docker-compose up -d # Spins up a local docker container with a postgres database
lein repl # Starts the REPL
```

With the REPL running, start the server using Integrant's `go` function. I usually start the server and then restart it with `reset-all` just in case. These functions are available in the `user` namespace and should be automatically loaded when you start the REPL. A function called `auto-reset` is also available. It automatically runs integrant's reset when changes are made to `.clj` and `.cljc` files.

To start the web client in development mode, run `yarn watch` or `npm run watch`. Shadow will automatically reload the application whenever there are changes to `.cljs` and `.cljc` files.

##### Testing
Server tests can be started by running `lein test`, which uses the `:test` profile from `project.clj`. This profile makes sure the project's tests are going to run using an in-memory datahike db.

Client tests can be started using `yarn test`. It is also possible to generate a compiled version of the client tests by running `npx shadow-cljs compile ci`. This compiled version of the tests can be ran using `npx karma start --single-run` - this version is specially useful for CIs.

It is also possible to run tests by namespace. This can done by `, t n` in Conjure or by calling `run namespace tests` from within cursive's command palette and is especially useful when some test is failing for some obscure reason.



##### Releasing:
It is possible to create release/production builds of the server and the application. To do so, run:
```bash
# for the server
lein uberjar
# a docker image can also be built for the server
docker build .
# for the client
yarn release # no support for offline mode/sw
yarn release-and-sw # offline mode/sw support
```
